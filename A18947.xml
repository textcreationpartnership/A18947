            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>EE that vndertakes to commend another mans writings vnto the view and reading of men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures his owne repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therein, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants doe their ſtocke in other mens ſhips. And there be two ſorts of men, that doe and may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture more boldly then others, either goods or credit: Firſt, ſuch as haue ſo much to ſpare, as that the loſſe of their aduenture will not pinch them; or ſuch as haue ſo little to aduenture, as no loſſe can hurt them much: Yet is there a middle ſort that doe aduenture in hope of good returnes.</p>
            <p>J take my ſelfe a man not vtterly deſperate, yet of poore eſtate, knowing nothing in my ſelfe that
<pb facs="tcp:8496:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>might procure reſpect vnto another mans wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; vnleſſe perhaps my acquaintance with many men of ſundry places, the purchaſe of my trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome pilgrimage, or the louing fauour which God of his goodneſſe hath giuen mee with many, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my worth: But if I had more reputation in the Church of God and my Countrey then euer J ſhall haue, I would not feare to aduenture all mine owne praiſes in the praiſe of this little Booke, and the Author thereof.</p>
            <p>The Author thereof, Master <hi>Thomas Clarke,</hi> one of my pariſhoners in <hi>Sutton-Coldfield,</hi> I know to be a man of much grauity, piety, and honeſty, &amp; for one of his ſort to be admired for his vnwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried paines in reading ſuch Authors as hee could, gathering out of them the pith of their diſcourſes or diſputes, and labouring to improue all, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſetling of his owne iudgement, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the ſtaying and ſatisfying of others popiſhly inclined, by conference or by writing: wherein alſo his ſucceſſe hath exceeded the harueſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other men, better languaged and more learned then be.</p>
            <p>Touching this his booke, it is true that onely the moulding of the Arguments againſt Popery is his
<pb facs="tcp:8496:3"/>owne, fitter perhaps for the vulgar ſort, then more exquiſite pieces. The matter it ſelfe is to be found in the writings of our learned Countreymen, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in large or many bookes, whereof ſome are not ſo eaſie to be had: But here is compiled and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted together in this popular forme, and in a ſtile (ſo farre as I can iudge) neither curious nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but well becomming the man and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The end and ayme of this good man, I perſwade my ſelfe to be honeſt and holy, not applauſe of men, nor gaine of money, but a true deſire to informe his countreymen that cannot or will not heare often or reade much in the knowledge of the truth, which detayning or reclayming them from Popery, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them in true religion eſtabliſhed in our Land, might yeeld them better Chriſtians, better Subiects, better Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Many haue long called for this Booke vpon ſight of ſome part of it, or report of others; theſe I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will gladly reade it: ſuch as neuer heard of it, or of the man, may pleaſe to make a tryall, whether or no they may finde in it, that which may refreſh the memory of learned and diligent men in much breuity, or bring light vnto the ignorant with as
<pb facs="tcp:8496:4"/>much perſpicuity; which is, I confeſſe, my opinion of the Booke.</p>
            <p>God quicken vp our hearts to more zeale for the Goſpell, and againſt popery, the zeale whereof in our aduerſaries ſhould prouoke vs to more zeale, or will condemne vs though it helpe not them; God alſo bleſſe this good old-Man that hath ſpent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for common good, aad bleſſe all meanes that may any way aduance the Kingdome of our Lord Ieſus, whether the ſcepter of Gouernement, the ſword of Warre, the preaching of the Goſpell, or Pen, or Print of wel-aduiſed and wel-affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE reade (Chriſtian Reader) in the ſecond Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3 <hi>verſe,</hi> of a generall apoſtacie, or departing from the true Faith, which the great Antichriſt ſhould bring to paſſe before the comming of Chriſt, and before hee ſhould be reuealed, or made manifeſt to the world. And wee read alſo in the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> and 10. <hi>verſe</hi> of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of a generall temptation or triall that ſhall come vpon the world, to trie them that dwell vpon the earth. And in the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> wee reade by whom this temptation ſhall be made: eſpecially in the 4. and 5. <hi>verſes,</hi> where it is ſaid of <hi>Romiſh Babylon,</hi> that ſhe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the world, <hi>In a cup of Gold</hi> (to wit in the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den name of Chriſt) <hi>the abhomination and filthineſſe of her fornication.</hi> And in the 3. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 18. <hi>chap.</hi> that ſhe made all nations to drinke thereof. And in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>verſe</hi> of the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> that ſhee made the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth drunke therewith. And therefore it is that the Angell in the 5. <hi>verſe</hi> calleth Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:8496:5"/>
               <hi>Rome, Babylon, The mother of whordomes, and abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth:</hi> and for which (as appeareth in the 2. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 19. <hi>chap.</hi>) the Lord hath condemned her.</p>
            <p>Now by this filthineſſe of her fornication, all the learned doe know, is meant her whoriſh religion, as idolatrie, ſuperſtition, and heatheniſh worſhip: which very many that are yet liuing doe know, did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow this Land, &amp; a great part of the Chriſtian world, before the daies of <hi>King Henry</hi> the eight, when as God had appointed the effectuall beginning of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and reſtoring againe of the true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as may appeare by a Prophecie written in an olde booke (I know not how many hundred yeeres agoe) Intituled, <hi>Stimulus diuinae contemplationis,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>After the yeere of Chriſts incarnation</hi> 1534. <hi>good Religion, good Lawes, good Peace, together with Faith, Truth, and ſound Doctrine ſhall returne into the world in their proper ſhape and true likeneſſe.</hi> And this was alſo at the time of the riſing of <hi>Luther,</hi> when as there was neither ſound doctrine, true faith, nor religion to be found in all the <hi>Romiſh</hi> iuriſdiction: according to that Prophecie of their S. <hi>Hildegard, a Nunne,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>In the Apoſtolike order</hi> (to wit, in the <hi>Roman Sea) no religion ſhall be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truely, (Chriſtian Reader) it ſeemeth very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that God hath made ſpeciall choyſe of England aboue all the Nations in the world, to be the chiefe for the recouering and reducing of that part of his Church (the <hi>Romiſh</hi> iuriſdiction) and the ouerthrow of Antichriſts kingdome and religion. For whereas in the 17. <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> the tenne hornes are declared to be the maine ſtrength of the ſeauen-hilled Citie (to wit <hi>Rome</hi>) and that the text declareth alſo
<pb facs="tcp:8496:5"/>thoſe hornes to be ſo many kingdomes, and that the learned expound them to be theſe tenne head king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> iuriſdiction, <hi>England, Scotland, Denmarke, &amp;c.</hi> (the firſt whereof, that withdrew her power from <hi>Rome,</hi> was England) it is manifeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is the chiefe.</p>
            <p>I know (Chriſtian Reader) it would be thought ſtrange to ſay, that that which was done by <hi>King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was foretold in the booke of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, a very learned man writing vpon theſe words, in the 13. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 11. <hi>chap. (And the tenth part of the Citie ſhall fall)</hi> ſaith plainely, <hi>It is a thouſand to one but that it is meant of King Henry:</hi> meaning his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his power from <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed it is tenne thouſand to one, but that it is meant of him: For plaine experience doth euidently demonſtrate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to be the chiefe of thoſe tenne Kingdomes alſo, which the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> declareth ſhall be the meanes of the finall fall of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and power of Antichriſt: for that, after this worke was ſet abroach by <hi>King Henry,</hi> we ſaw it ſo greatly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vnder the raigne of that famous Queene his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that at her deceaſe, the Pope had ſcarce three of thoſe Kingdomes (ſignified by thoſe hornes) left to adhere with him intirely. And I doe finde alſo by diuers of the olde <hi>Romiſh</hi> Predictions, that as God made <hi>King Henry</hi> the maine beginner of the ruine and decay of the ſtrength of <hi>Romiſh Babylon,</hi> ſo he hath ordained a moſt worthy <hi>King</hi> of the name of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to ſecond him in that worke. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which ſhall be further effected by him, thus hath their <hi>Robertus</hi> a <hi>Dominican Frier</hi> written long
<pb facs="tcp:8496:6"/>agoe in his ſecond <hi>Sermon.</hi> But <hi>Iacob flying from the Serpents face,</hi> (which Serpent in his third <hi>viſion,</hi> hee affirmeth the ſpirit told him was Antichriſt the <hi>Pope) is ioyned to thoſe that doe praiſe my name.</hi> For which cauſe (hee declareth) the <hi>Pope</hi> (whom in the ſame Sermon hee compareth to <hi>Eſau</hi>) ſhould put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the deſtruction of the ſpirituall <hi>Iacob,</hi> as alſo for refuſing to ioyne with him, and to be of his ſocietie: For there hee bringeth in the Pope, ſpeaking in this manner to his ſpirituall ſonnes; <hi>Goe to my Sonnes, and enter into a conſultation among your ſelues, how I may bring him vnder; for by his deſtruction my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhall bee exceedingly increaſed: I haue neede of much, becauſe the name of my houſe is great vpon the face of the earth. Deglutiamus eum virum: Come therefore, let vs ſwallow him vp aliue.</hi> Which Prophecie, albeit wee ſaw fulfilled in the Powder-treaſon, yet as the ſame <hi>Frier</hi> ſheweth, that all the <hi>Pope</hi> could doe ſhould nothing at all preuaile; ſo, thankes be to our good God we ſaw it did not.</p>
            <p>Againe, the ſame <hi>Frier,</hi> in his ſixeteenth Sermon, fore-ſheweth that it ſhall come to paſſe, that the ſame <hi>Iacob</hi> (whom there hee calleth the <hi>Lyon King</hi>) ſhall viſite the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> and other Catholique Princes of Chriſtendome, by his Chriſtian and royall exhortations, to helpe to ſubdue the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to bring the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſtate of primitiue puritie, as it was in the happy dayes of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Theodoſius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby he declareth, not onely how greatly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is fallen from her primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue purity in religion, but alſo, that ſhee ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſpeciall meanes of our Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8496:6"/>And to the like effect are theſe words of their Saint <hi>Bridgit,</hi> (cannonized for a Saint by <hi>Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the ninth) in her ſixt booke of <hi>Reuelations,</hi> 26. chap. where ſhe bringeth in Chriſt complayning of the decaied ſtate of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhewing him to exhort all Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi> what courſe to take for the perfect reformation thereof, ſaying; <hi>Wherefore the King for whom thou dost pray, ought to call and aſſemble a Councell of Spirituall men, ſuch as are wiſe through my wiſedome; and he ought to enquire diligently of thoſe that haue my ſpirite, and aske their aduice, how, and by what meanes the wall of my Church may be built againe amongst Christians, how God may be reſtored to his honour, true Religion made to flouriſh anew, godly charity made more feruent, my paſsion more deepely imprinted in the hearts and mindes of men, and my Commaundements loued with greater zeale and reſpect: Let him therefore gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vpright and true kinde of Christians, that hee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, may repaire the ſpirituall breaches of my Church, the which verily hath departed too farre from mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which wee ſee, ſhee giueth all true Chriſtian Princes to vnderſtand, that God requireth of them, that they ioyne together, and vſe all meanes by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned inſtructers, to reclayme the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and to reduce her to that moſt auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith and religion, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her for at the firſt: which albeit at the firſt, or on the ſodaine ſhee will not receiue; but as their <hi>Abbot Ioachim</hi> vpon the 22. chapter of <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſayth: <hi>Will ſtoppe her eares, leſt ſhee ſhould heare the charming of the inchaunter, the voyce of him that admoniſheth her:</hi> yet vpon the 15.17.18.21. and 22. chapters, he ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:8496:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>that thoſe admonitions ſhall, in ſhort time, ſo worke, that not onely the <hi>Germaine</hi> Empire ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Church it ſelfe, with her <hi>Colledge of Cardinalls ſhal be diuided, and fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among themſelues.</hi> And vpon the 50. and 51. of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> he ſheweth by the effect, that thoſe admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall ſo greatly preuaile, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and the whole order of his Clergie, his Conſiſtorie and State, ſhall be exceedingly impaired. For (ſaith he) <hi>The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Romaine Church ſhall periſh, the Monasteries ſhall be diminiſhed, the High. Prieſt ſhall be purified, and Chriſtian Religion ſhall be winnowed as with a fanne.</hi> And the ſame alſo did their Saint <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Sienne</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, as may appeare by theſe her words written in a prayer of hers: <hi>But what ſhall the Lord doe to theſe euill husband men? he ſhall come and deſtroy them, and let out his Vineyard vnto others, &amp;c. By tribulations and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in ſuch a manner as we know not, he ſhall purge his Church, and to that purpoſe ſhall ſtirre vp the ſpirits of his Elect. After which things</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>ſhall enſue ſuch a reformation of the holy Church, and ſuch a renouation of the godly Paſtors thereof, that the very thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh my ſpirit to reioyce in the Lord.

Yea, the very Infidells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne with the ſweete ſmell of Chriſt, ſhall repaire vnto the Catholike ſheepfold, and be conuerted to the chiefe Paſtor and Biſhop of their ſoules.</hi> And this is it alſo which <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did foreſee, as may appeare by theſe his words, written in his nineteenth
<pb facs="tcp:8496:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>booke the ninth chap. vpon <hi>Iob: The Church after the dayes of her afflictions, ſhall afterwards, notwithſtanding, be ſtrengthened with great power of preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it may yet more plainely appeare, that our Nation of <hi>England</hi> ſhall beare ſome ſway in this worke, the aforeſaid <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> in his ſixt <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> declareth that it was reuealed vnto him, <hi>That the Ile of Britaine ſhould proue the chiefe receptacle</hi> of the Church of God, and euen an <hi>Aſile</hi> or <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and as it were her nurſing mother, after ſhe ſhould come to be thus reformed: and that the true Chriſtian religion ſhould be maintained eſpecially by the bleſſed meanes of the people of the aforeſaid <hi>Iſle.</hi> For, <hi>As the title of his Viſion</hi> (ſaith the Tranſlator) <hi>is of the future ſtate of the Church, ſo the Viſion it ſelfe doth beare how he did ſeeme to be together with ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a ſmall number in a certaine great ſhip, not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with Ruthers or Oares in the maine Sea, and that the ſhippe came as it were of it ſelfe vnto a certaine Iſland, whereunto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we being but a few, had our recourſe for refuge and ſafety.</hi> Alſo to the like effect there is this prognoſticall <hi>verſe,</hi> aledged by <hi>Ioannes Wolfius</hi> in the ſecond <hi>tome of his memorable things:</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> thus:
<q>
                  <l>Europa genit us terra, vir iuſt us &amp; aequus</l>
                  <l>Paſtor erit, Caeli claues non regna gubernans.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In Engliſh thus; <hi>A certaine wight equitable and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right borne in</hi> Europe, <hi>ſhall be the chiefe Paſtor or Biſhop of Chriſtendome, ſuch a one as ſhall mannage and gouerne the Keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, and not the Scepters of the kingdomes of the earth. There ſhall be peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb facs="tcp:8496:8"/>in the world one Faith and Religion, and once Prince imperially raigning ouer all.</hi> Alſo their <hi>Paracelſus</hi> the <hi>German Hermite,</hi> in his 26. Prediction, maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Engliſh Prince and his iſſue, that ſhall more fully effect this worke of reformation. And in an old Propheſie had out of the <hi>Pallace of wiſdome, in Rome;</hi> and in another Propheſie of <hi>Sauanarola,</hi> a <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> mention is made of a Prince of the name of <hi>Charles,</hi> that ſhall ſtrike a great ſtroke in this worke, and ſhall bring to paſſe, that in the end, according to a Propheſie alſo of <hi>Noſtrodamus, Rome</hi> ſhall be ruled by her old <hi>Britanniſh</hi> head.</p>

               <p>And ſaith Maiſter <hi>Iames Maxwell</hi> (the Tranſlater) <hi>As the Italian Ieſuite Heronymus Platus</hi> in the ſecond booke of <hi>Religious life,</hi> chap. 30. confeſſeth England to haue beene more fertill of conuerters of Nations and Countries to the Chriſtian faith, then any other Land elſe; ſo is it not vnlikely but that God will haue the ſame Country to be more fertill of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of other corrupt Churches, eſpecially of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> then any other Land whatſoeuer. And that as there is in no one Country or Nation of the world to be found ſo many learned and eloquent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor ſo many compleat Diuines, for <hi>Iudiciouſneſſe, Ingenuouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> and for fitneſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue well for the peace of the Church, as there is in England; ſo it is like that God will honour this <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland</hi> with the reformation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her daughters, by ſending forth from thence, ſuch godly, iudicious, zealous, and moderate men, as ſhall reclaime them from their abuſes, and reſtore
<pb facs="tcp:8496:8"/>vnto them their Primitiue puritie and integritie, ſuch as it was in the happie daies of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> borne in great Britannie. For (ſaith hee) <hi>To the ſame effect ſoundeth this prognosticall verſe, which was found in an old manuſcript:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Ieſſe Roſa ſanguis Bruti</l>

               </p>
               <p>Alſo as their <hi>Ioachim</hi> the <hi>Abbot,</hi> writing vpon the 4.5.18.22. and 30. Chapter of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ſheweth that there ſhall be certaine new Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the Catholique or Vniuerſall Church, ſtrong in faith, and true in Doctrine, whoſe Doctrine ſhall be open and free, and that they ſhall preach Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance both to the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and conuert many of them to the truth; ſo is there a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie vttered in the yeare of Chriſt, 1119. as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his 475. <hi>Page</hi> of this <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which ſaith; <hi>They that walke in darkeneſſe, ſhall turne to the light, and thoſe things that were diuided and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhall be gathered together and vnited.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo, the ſame <hi>Abbot</hi> ſheweth, how that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Prelates</hi> will rage againſt thoſe whom God ſhall ſend to conuert them, where hee writing vpon the firſt Chapter of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ſaith thus; <hi>Such Doctors and Prophets are to be ſent, which ſhall not onely rebuke the people, but alſo thunder out againſt the Prieſts, and ſtrike earthly and carnall hearts with all maner of plagues, and put to ſilence the loftie and ſwelling Maiſters, who ſhall fight againſt the aforeſaid Preachers which ſhall be reuealed, as once did Iuda againſt Iſrael, and the Iewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi> By meanes whereof, the
<pb facs="tcp:8496:9"/>death of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond <hi>King of Spaine</hi>) in his <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum mundi filum,</hi> doth deliuer, that <hi>The Lyon hauing the Roſe and the Lillies in his armes, ſhall vtterly deſtroy the Pope, ſo as that afterwards there ſhall neuer be any more Popes.</hi> And then all Chriſtian Princes, being at peace and vnitie, it ſeemeth by a Prediction found in an olde Booke, that they ſhall conſent and agree, to chuſe out of all, one excellent Man for learning and good life, to be as a chiefe Moderator, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſorts of people in the whole world to one kinde of Religion, and all Churches into one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme order: For thus it is written in that Propheſie, <hi>The afflictions of the Church and Clergie being paſſed; and after ſo many &amp; great tribulations, by the will of God, a moſt holy man ſhall be choſen, perfect in all manner of perfection, who ſhall reforme the World in better, and ſhall bring backe all Clergie-men to the ancient and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue manner of liuing, according to the forme of the Diſciples of Chriſt: He ſhall conuert the Infidels, and the Iewes, &amp;c. And ſo there ſhall be one Law, one faith, and one Baptiſme, and one manner of liuing; and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people ſhall be of one minde, and of one heart, louing one another, and their peace ſhall laſt many yeares: but after the world hath beene reformed into better, the malice of men ſhall againe awake, and they ſhall returne to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the former euils, yea they ſhall doe more wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then ere they did before, for the which cauſe God ſhall haſten the end of the World.</hi> And as the authors of thoſe Propheſies (who fore-told of the vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſeemed to allude vnto the 21.22.23. and 24. Verſes of the eighteenth chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> by which words in thoſe Verſes, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell fore-ſhewed the ſame; ſo the latter end of this
<pb facs="tcp:8496:9"/>old Propheſie, ſeemeth to haue relation to theſe words of Chriſt in the 12. Verſe of the 24. Chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew: And becauſe iniquitie ſhall be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the loue of many ſhall be cold:</hi> As alſo, to theſe words in the 22. Verſe (according to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſome) <hi>And except thoſe daies ſhould be ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there ſhould no fleſh be ſaued: But for the Elect ſake, thoſe daies ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> And the former part ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth alſo to allude vnto thoſe words in the ſixe and twentieth and 27. Verſes of the 7. Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which ſheweth, that after Antichriſt and his Kingdome is ouerthrowne, the fulneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall come in, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſo all ſhall be conuerted to the truth, and ſerue the onely true God. Neuertheleſſe, wee may not vnderſtand it to be meant of euery particular of all. For howſoeuer Antichriſt the Head, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue incorporate body, ſhall vtterly be deſolued, ſo as that there ſhall neuer be any more a publique Church of Antichriſt; yet euen as it is now here in England, and the other conuerted Nations, ſome of the members of the miſticall body of Antichriſt, will remaine ſcattered here and there in diuers parts of the World to the comming of Chriſt to iudgement. For to the ſame effect are theſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> 2. Chapter, where he ſpeaking of Antichriſt and his members, ſaith; <hi>Whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and aboliſh with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his comming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as that old Propheſie did foreſhew the calling of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by the meanes of a godly and learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſo in another Prediction had out of the Biſhop of <hi>Limoges Library</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> vttered more then 600.
<pb facs="tcp:8496:10"/>Yeeres agoe, it is ſaid that an holy Biſhop ſhall cauſe a generall <hi>Councell</hi> to be called, and ſhall perſwade Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes to ioyne together all their powers againſt the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> and to rid <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> of them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the ſame Biſhop, becauſe of the iniquity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhall tranſlate Saint <hi>Peters Chaire</hi> to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and ſhall ſuffer none other <hi>Law,</hi> but that onely of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And to this agreeth that Propheſie of <hi>Sauanarola</hi> the <hi>Dominican Friar,</hi> which (to ſhew, that as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the firſt Church, and the chiefe of all other, ſo it ſhould be at the laſt) ſaith thus: <hi>I ſaw in a viſion in the yeere of our Lord,</hi> 1482. <hi>two Croſſes, the one was blacke, planted in the middeſt of the City of Rome, ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were the armes ouer the whole Earth, and with the top touching the whole Heauen; whereon was written theſe words;</hi> Crux Irae Dei: <hi>The Croſſe of Gods anger or wrath: which hauing ſeene, behold incontinent, I beheld and ſaw the aire darkened and troubled with tempestuous cloudes, windes, lightnings, darts, ſwords, fire, and haile; and mee thought I ſaw an innumerable number of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed through the force and violence thereof, ſo that few were left behinde vnſlaine: Afterwards, I ſaw a ſweete, faire, and cleare time enſuing; and loe, I beheld, and ſaw as it were a golden Croſſe in the middeſt of Ieruſalem, of the brightneſſe and height of the former, ſo bright that it did inlighten the whole World, and filled the ſame with new ioy and gladneſſe; and it had written vpon it.</hi> Crux miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiae Dei. <hi>The Croſſe of the mercy and fauour of God: and loe, incontinent and on a ſuddaine, all the Nations of the World, of both Sexe came in troupes from all parts to behold it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay, cap. 2. Verſe 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and imbraced it.</hi> And this Viſion ſeemeth to agree with that Propheſie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. the 2. where
<pb facs="tcp:8496:10"/>it is ſaid: <hi>It ſhall be in the laſt dayes, that the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be prepared in the top of the mountaines, and ſhall be exalted aboue the hilles, and all Nations ſhall flow vnto it.</hi> And alſo with theſe words of Saint <hi>Paul, Romans</hi> 11. <hi>If the fall of them</hi> (to wit, <hi>the Iewes) be the riches of the World, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more ſhall their abundance be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which, and other ſuch like Viſions (ſaith the Tranſlator) <hi>the aforeſaid holy man</hi> Sauanarola <hi>was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of the future castigation and renouation of the Church of Rome, and how that the Apoſtolike Sea ſhould be remoued from thence to Ieruſalem, which is likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prediction of the Franciſcan Friar,</hi> Ioannes de Rupe ſciſſa, <hi>and alſo to another Prediction had out of</hi> Limoges <hi>Library in</hi> France; <hi>and finally, to the Prediction of</hi> Marlinus Caldidonius.</p>
               <p>And now (Chriſtian Reader) as it ſeemeth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by theſe <hi>Romiſh Predictions</hi> (agreeable to the Scriptures) that God reſpecteth <hi>England,</hi> as the holy Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo is it made yet more apparant by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> in his ſecond Booke of his <hi>Kings,</hi> and ſecond Booke of his <hi>Biſhops;</hi> where hee ſheweth that in a Viſion to holy <hi>Brithwall</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> this voyce was vttered; <hi>Regnum Anglorum eſt Dei:</hi> The Kingdome of England is Gods. Which ſignifieth, that howſoeuer all the Nations in the world are Gods as well as <hi>England;</hi> yet hath God made ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall choyce of <hi>England</hi> aboue all other Nations in the World, to effect ſome notable and extraordinary worke; which worke we may eaſily gather by all the former Predictions, is to be a chiefe inſtrument of the propagation of the Goſpell to forraigne Lands, both
<pb facs="tcp:8496:11"/>for the calling in of the remainder of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and alſo of the whole Nation of the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the which I beſeech our Lord God, to giue good ſucceſſe, and to ſend peace and agreement amongſt the <hi>Electors.</hi> For their Aſtrologian <hi>Ruth,</hi> in the ſecond part of his Booke, 7. Chapter, ſheweth that there ſhall be great tribulation and diuiſion amongſt them, and therefore admoniſheth them to agree, leſt the Turke get ſo great aduantage by their diſcord, as to driue the <hi>Bohemian, Polonians, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to be glad to contract a league of amity with him: which thing God forbid, and which we ought all to pray God to auert: For now we ſee is the time come for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Propheſie.</p>

               <head>Lord giue a bleſſing to my labour: and open the eyes of the blinde.</head>
               <p>But now, what good effect can wee looke to haue, that the fruit of this our labour ſhould any thing at all preuaile to conuert any Papiſts, ſeeing we finde in the 16. Chapter, 10. Verſe. and 9. Chapter, 20.21. Verſes of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that neither the Word of God, nor the iudgements of God ſhall conuert them? ſurely none, were it not that the Lord in the 4.

               <p>And that it may appeare to the Reader, they are indeed the ſame, what can make it more apparent, then their appoſing themſelues againſt the Doctrine of Chriſt himſelfe? For whereas the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> chap. 4. fore-told of <hi>Elias</hi> that was to come, and that our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. expoundeth that to be meant of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> in ſaying of him, <hi>This is that</hi> Elias <hi>that was to come; Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare:</hi> They ſticke not to appoſe themſelues againſt his plaine expoſition, and conſtantly affirme, that the ſame <hi>Elias</hi> is yet to come.

Verſe, ſheweth <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to be the ſame of whom <hi>Malachi</hi> fore-told; who, as hee ſaith, <hi>Came in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to prepare the way for Christ:</hi> They ſay that the end of his comming, is to appoſe himſelfe againſt Antichriſt. And this is done to make vs beleeue that Antichriſt is not yet come. But in the meane time, their affirming <hi>Elias</hi> to be yet to come (which ſhould come but once) and that onely to manifeſt the <hi>Meſsias</hi> to bee verily come; What is this, but by a conſequent, to affirme, that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> is yet to come, and ſo our faith in him that is come, is made voyd, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
               <p>Againe, whereas our Sauiour Chriſt, as appeareth <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. ſaith; <hi>And this Goſpel of the Kingdome
<pb facs="tcp:8496:12"/>ſhall be preached through out the whole World for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to all Nations, and then ſhall the end come:</hi> They peruert both words &amp; ſenſe, &amp; ſay; <hi>And then ſhall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist come.</hi> And this alſo is done only to make men beleeue that Antichriſt is not yet come, that no man ſhould once ſuſpect the <hi>Pope</hi> to be he, albeit the truth forceth all men to beleeue the contrary. But it may well appeare they meane nothing leſſe, then that the truth ſhould come to light; for then <hi>N. D.</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the <hi>Ward-word,</hi> in alledging the 8. Verſe of the 11. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> to proue the ſeat of Antichriſt to be in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> would not haue taken out of the Text, the word <hi>Spiritually</hi> (which all men may ſee, the holy Ghoſt put in purpoſely to preſerue the ſenſe) that he might adde a contrary, <hi>to wit,</hi> ſuch a ſenſe of his owne, as ſhould ſhadow <hi>Rome</hi> for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be the ſeate, and the <hi>Pope</hi> from being An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. I ſay, if hee had beene willing the Reader ſhould haue beene reſolued by truth, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue done it.</p>
               <p>But what hath he gotten by this his adding, and deminiſhing too and from the words and ſenſe of that Propheſie, let him looke into the 18. and 19. Verſes of the 22. chap. of the ſame Booke, and he ſhall finde it to be no leſſe then eternall damnation both of body and ſoule, becauſe it is wittingly done?</p>
               <p>Againe, if he had beene willing that men ſhould haue beene reſolued by the truth, he might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue found out the ſeate of Antichriſt to be in <hi>Rome,</hi> then in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> becauſe the 17. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> ſheweth it to be in the Citie with ſeauen hills, and which raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth; but <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was neuer deſcribed by
<pb facs="tcp:8496:12"/>ſeauen hills, nor euer raigned ouer the Kings of the earth, nor any other Citie in all the world, but <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore not <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but <hi>Rome,</hi> is the ſeate of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, if he had been willing that the truth ſhould haue reſolued the Reader, (who hee is, that is in deed and truth the great Antichriſt) hee would neuer haue wreſted and falſified ſo many places of Scripture, as appeareth (in his <hi>Ward-word,</hi> Page 91.92.) he hath done wittingly, to proue him a <hi>Iewe,</hi> and to dominiere onely ouer that one Nation of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> I ſay, if hee had beene willing that men ſhould haue beene reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the truth, he would neuer haue done it. If he ſhall charge vs with doing him wrong, for ſaying hee hath wreſted and falſified the places he hath cited; I ſay againe, not any one of his places doth proue the point: if it did, then hee hath done himſelfe the wrong; for that after ſo many places cited, hee bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the 5. Verſe of the 13. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which being vnderſtood (as he would haue it) of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, the three next Verſes following, proueth him a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and a <hi>Roman:</hi> vnto whom (as the Text ſaith) <hi>Power was giuen ouer euery kindred, tongue, and Nation, and whom the World worſhipped.</hi> So that here he hath vtterly ſhamed himſelfe, for that this Text (as he vnderſtandeth it) proueth all his former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections but Antichriſtian illuſions, and fond fables.</p>
               <p>Againe, if he had beene willing that the Reader ſhould haue beene reſolued by the truth, hee would not haue laboured to haue enduced him to beleeue that Antichriſt ſhould ſeduce the <hi>Iewes,</hi> &amp; that they ſhould receiue him for their <hi>Meſsias</hi> and Sauiour, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cannot proue by any one place of Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:8496:13"/>(from the firſt chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the laſt chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that there ſhall be any other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, or alteration of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſtate to come, but onely that in the 11. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, ſhall be their conuertion to Chriſt, and the ſame to continue to the comming of Chriſt to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Againe, if he had beene willing men ſhould haue beene reſolued by the truth, hee would neuer haue expounded the Image of the <hi>Heatheniſh Roman</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, to be a painted picture, or a carued I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the likeneſſe of ſome kind of cattell, or beaſt, onely to blind the World, that men ſhould not ſee the <hi>Popiſh</hi> gouernement to be the Image. Howbeit, let them looke into the 8. verſe of the 14. chap. and they ſhall ſee; and into the 9.10. and 11. Verſes of the ſame, and they ſhall know, to their euerlaſting woe, that by the Beaſt is meant the <hi>Heathen Roman</hi> gouernment, and by the image of the beaſt, the <hi>Popiſh Roman</hi> gouernment. But he that was the author of the <hi>Ward-word,</hi> would not that men ſhould know this. Therefore we ſee, he is not willing that men ſhould be reſolued by the truth.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in generall, had beene willing the truth ſhould haue come to light, that men might haue beene reſolued in the truth of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they would not in the <hi>Remiſh Teſtament,</hi> haue expounded <hi>Babylon</hi> (in the ſeauententh chapter of the <hi>Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) to ſignifie the Vniuerſall ſocietie of the wicked, ſeeing the holy Ghoſt ſheweth in the ſame Chapter, that by <hi>Babylon,</hi> is meant the Citie with ſeauen hils, and that raigned ouer the Kings of the earth: But to ſay that the Reprobates of the world, are ſcituated
<pb facs="tcp:8496:13"/>vpon thoſe ſeauen hils, and raigned ouer the Kings of the earth, is moſt ridiculous. Therefore, we ſee they are not willing the truth ſhould come to light.</p>
               <p>Againe, if they had beene willing that men ſhould haue beene reſolued by the truth, they would neuer haue giuen that expoſition; ſeeing that by <hi>Babylon,</hi> is ſignified alſo the woman offering to the World, in the name of Chriſt, her whoriſh Religion, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the 4. Verſe of the ſame chapter.</p>
               <p>Againe, if they had beene willing to haue brought the truth to light, that men might haue beene truely reſolued in that point; then, ſeeing the Angell in the ſame place, ſhewed to Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that hee ſpake to him of <hi>Romes</hi> eſtate, offering to the World her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a Golden cup (that is, in the name of Chriſt) they would neuer haue expounded it of <hi>Heatheniſh Rome</hi> vnder the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours; for they know as well as wee, that ſhe diſdained once to handle that cup, and perſecuted any whoſoeuer offered to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truth therein.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould we ſtand any longer in the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticion of theſe things now, ſeeing that by the holy Ghoſt, the miſterie of the Golden cup is reuealed, and the truth laid open, that it is Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Angell called <hi>Babylon, the mother of whoredomes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of the earth.</hi> And then ſeeing Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> is the mother of whordomes and abominations of the earth, the <hi>Pope</hi> muſt needes be the father of whordomes and abominations of the earth: and he that is the father of whordomes and abominations of the earth, muſt needes be the great Antichriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here all their mouthes are ſtopped, and all their cunning arguments deſolued, and all their chiefe
<pb facs="tcp:8496:14"/>points, craftie ſhifts, and vntruths abandoned, which they would haue, ſhould make vs to beleeue that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is not yet come, that wee ſhould not ſuſpect the <hi>Pope</hi> to be he.</p>
               <p>As touching the expoſition of the Golden cup, let them deny it to be the true meaning of the holy Ghoſt if they dare; but they haue denied too much of the truth of that Booke already, as one day they ſhall finde.</p>
               <p>All the benefits of ſaluation which wee receiue in Chriſt, the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 116. calleth the <hi>Cup of ſaluation.</hi> And his name may well be called the Golden Cup, becauſe as S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19. <hi>There is giuen none other name vnder heauen, whereby men muſt be ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet to ſhew that all that profeſſe Chriſt ſhall not be ſaued, our Sauiour Chriſt fore-telleth, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnder his name many ſhall be deceiued: which ſurely is a wonderfull great iudgement of God, vpon that people whoſoeuer they be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſmus</hi> expounding the miſterie of that cup, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that that which is offered therein, is nothing elſe but the <hi>Popes</hi> religion, which (he ſaith) he offereth in the name of Chriſt, to deceiue the world. And their <hi>Abbot Ioachim</hi> witneſſeth the ſame, as may plainely appeare in his 37. chapter vpon the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> where he complaining of the corruption of the <hi>Popes,</hi> ſaith: <hi>They doe neglect Incenſe and Myrrh, but they ſeeke after Gold, that they may with Babylon, the great Lady of the world, fill vnto men Wine in a golden Cup, to infect their followers with their abhominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus by the opening the miſterie of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cup, we ſee the Lord hath now made knowne to
<pb facs="tcp:8496:14"/>his Church, that Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> profeſſing Chriſt, is Antichriſt. Yea, the ſame of whom Saint <hi>Hylary</hi> ſaith:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hylary</hi> contra <hi>Auxenium.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Antichrist ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christ, vnder a colour of preaching the Goſpell, ſo that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall then be denied, when a man would thinke he were preached.</hi> And herein alſo the <hi>Pope</hi> agreeth to the ſignification of the name, as it is in the <hi>Greeke;</hi> namely, to be both for, and againſt Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 2. to ſit as the Church, the deare friend of Chriſt, and yet to be as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>An aduerſarie:</hi> Therefore, doubtleſſe, he cannot be ſaid to be the great Antichriſt, that is, not ouer-ruling all, both for and againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Their Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> intreating of the end of the World, ſheweth of two kindes of Antichriſts, the one he calleth a pure Antichriſt, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Turke;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he calleth a mixed kind of Antichriſt, which he ſaith ſhall be an euill <hi>Pope,</hi> made by an euill prince of great power, alluding to <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who was made the firſt <hi>Pope,</hi> by that Murtherer <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> And their <hi>Aſtrologian Ruth,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antichriſt, ſaith: <hi>Hee ſhall be called Antichriſtus mixtus, whom the Prelates ſhall greatly honour.</hi> And this he ſpake, not of himſelfe, for hee found it ſo written in an olde Propheſie, as himſelfe confeſſeth in his thirtie foure Chapter, of the ſecond part of his Booke.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, and to draw to an end; this I aduiſe the Reader to note well, that foraſmuch as the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 4.6. ſheweth, that as there is but one God, and that he alone is the Vniuerſall father of all; And that Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Matthew</hi> 23.9. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the title of Vniuerſall father to be giuen to any,
<pb facs="tcp:8496:15"/>but to the Father of Heauen; it is cleare he is a moſt horrible blaſphemer, that will call the moſt holieſt man vpon the earth, vniuerſall Father of all: much more hee that will call Antichriſt, the <hi>Pope,</hi> vniuerſall father of all, ſeeing the Holy ghoſt calleth him, <hi>The man of ſinne, and ſonne of perdition,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Againe, foraſmuch as the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Galatians</hi> 4.26. ſaith, <hi>Ieruſalem which is aboue, is the mother of vs all:</hi> he is a moſt horrible blaſphemer, that will call the moſt holieſt Citie heere beneath, the mother of vs all: much more hee that will call <hi>Rome</hi> the Mother of vs all, which the Angell of God calleth <hi>Babylon, The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whoredomes and abominations of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, foraſmuch as the very ſelfe and ſame reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which <hi>Rome</hi> now offereth to the world in the name of Chriſt, is by the Angell in the 4 verſe of the 17. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> compared vnto the ſtinking filthineſſe of a whoores fornication, he muſt needes be a moſt horrible blaſphemer, that will call it, The moſt auncient, true, and holy Catholique religion.</p>
               <p>Againe, foraſmuch as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſalon.</hi> 2. declareth, that the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſhall be with great ſignes and wonders, yea, ſo great and wonderfull, that as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. <hi>If it were poſſible, they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the very Elect.</hi> Hee therefore that will ſay, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needes be the true Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee worketh miracles, is a moſt horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</p>
               <p>Miracles are wrought in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the ſpirits of Diuels, as appeareth in the 16. chapter and 14. verſe of the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> Therefore miracles
<pb facs="tcp:8496:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>are not alwayes a true note of the true Church. And this appeareth alſo in the thirteenth chapter of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi> where we may ſee, that a moſt vile kinde of people, euen ſuch as God abhorred, wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to draw others to their religion. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo declareth, 2. <hi>Theſſalon.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 10. that Antichriſt ſhall worke his miracles among them that periſh: therefore miracles are not alwayes a true note of the true Church.</p>
               <p>Againe, our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7.22. decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that at the day of Iudgement, certaine Chriſtian Miniſters that were wont to confirme their doctrine by miracles, when they ſhall ſee themſelues caſt out to be damned with reprobates, they will admire, and ſay thus to Chriſt: <hi>Lord, Lord, haue we not by thy Name prophecied, and by thy Name caſt out Diuels, and done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great workes? And then</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will profeſſe to them, I neuer knew you, depart from me yee that worke iniquitie. Popiſh</hi> Miniſters worke miracles, our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters worke none; they themſelues therefore ſhall be iudges in this caſe, to which of theſe ſort of Miniſters, this Scripture may iuſtly be applyed.</p>
               <p>Certainely, the greateſt iudgement that God doth lay vpon men in this life, is to blinde their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with <hi>Poperie;</hi> for then they are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any errour, and to reiect the truth; to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the marke of the Beaſt, and to receiue the print of his name, and to periſh with the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, as it is moſt certaine they ſhall: For thus it is written in the nineteenth chapter of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation</hi> verſe 20. <hi>But the Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe prophet that wrought miracles before him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:8496:16"/>he deceiued them that receiued the Beaſts marke, and them that worſhipped his image. Theſe both were aliue caſt into a lake of fire, burning with brimſtone.</hi> Therefore to conclude this, I ſay to all thoſe that haue receiued the marke of the Beaſt, in their forehead, or on their hand; that is, they that haue outwardly profeſſed with their mouthes and geſtures; and thoſe alſo that haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Armes, written Bookes, wrought Miracles, or any way laid to their helping hand, to do any thing whereby the <hi>Popes</hi> kingdome and ſtate is maintained, Damnation ſhall be their end. For as the Angell of God, in the foureteenth chapter of the ſame booke, 9.10. and 11. verſes ſaith, <hi>If any man worſhip the Beaſt, and his Image, and receiue his marke in his forehead, or on their hand, the ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, yea, of the pure wine which is powred into the Cup of his wrath, and he ſhal be termented in fire and brimſtone before the holie Angells, and before the Lambe, and the ſmoake of their torment ſhall aſcend euermore: and they ſhall haue no reſt day nor night, which worſhip the Beast and his image: and whoſoeuer receiueth the print of his name,</hi> That is, whoſoeuer is content to be called by any ſuch name, as whereby he may be knowne to be the <hi>Popes</hi> faithfull ſubiect. Therefore I aduertiſe them all, in the name of God, that they receiue his fatherly admonitions, and call to minde, how louingly the Lord in the fourth verſe of the eighteenth chapter of the ſame Booke, calleth his Elect out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they be not partakers of her ſinnes, leſt they ſhould alſo receiue of her plagues. As for thoſe that regard not this louing fauour of God, but will notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abide in her ſtill, and goe on with her in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations,
<pb facs="tcp:8496:16"/>let them goe, and doe what they will. <hi>He that is vniust</hi> (ſaith the Lord in the 22. chapter) <hi>let him be vniust ſtill, and he that is filthy, let him be filthie ſtill; and hee that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill. And behold, I come ſhortly, and my reward is with mee, to giue to euery man as his worke ſhall be.</hi>

               <hi>11</hi> That wee ought to pray to God alone, and not to Saints: And to worſhip God alone, and not Saints. That none can be mediatour betweene God and man, but onely he that is partaker of the natures both of God and man.</p>

            <p>The Chapter of Concluſion ſheweth, that we are iustified in the ſight of God, by faith onely without workes.

                  <p n="20">20 Heere hee noteth out Antichriſt, by three ſpeciall miracles, which he ſaith he ſhall worke: which becauſe no <hi>Pope</hi> hitherto hath wrought, they cannot be Antichriſt. Touching the firſt, namely, that he ſhall make fire deſcend from heauen: wee ſay, That foraſmuch as there is no time ſet downe, when that miracle ſhall be wrought: and that there remayneth a <hi>Pope,</hi> and how many ſhall ſucceede him, who can tell, all which make the great Antichriſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till the full end and terme of their reigne, and that it can be proued, that not any one <hi>Pope,</hi> euer wrought that miracle, none of the predeceſſours are cleared from being Antichriſt: for we find throughout the whole Scriptures, that whatſoeuer is done by any one of them, is imputed vnto all.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 But as touching the true ſenſe of thoſe words, diuers of the Learned doe conclude, that by making fire deſcend from heauen, is meant, that he ſhould doe ſuch miracles, and ſo great wonders, as ſhould as greatly preuaile, to draw the people from God to himſelfe, as the fire, that came downe from heauen (at the prayer of <hi>Elias</hi>) did preuaile to draw the people from <hi>Baall</hi> to God:

                        </gap>. 38.39.</note> and that it is no more meant, that Antichriſt ſhould cauſe fire really to deſcend from heauen, then in the eleuenth chapter, that materiall fire ſhould proceede out of the two witneſſes mouthes, and deſtroy their enemies: or in the ninth chapter, that out of horſes mouthes, ſhould iſſue fire, ſmoake and brimſtone to deuoure men.</p>
                  <p n="22">22 Secondly, he ſaith that Antichriſt ſhall make the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a beaſt to ſpeake: We anſwere. The text ſaith not, of <hi>a</hi> beaſt, but of <hi>The</hi> beaſt. That is, as the <hi>verſe</hi> going
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8496:32"/>before ſaith: <hi>The Image of the beaſt which had the wound of a ſword and did liue.</hi> Which as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> expoundeth, was the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> domination vnder the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Emperours of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whoſe heatheniſhneſſe was almoſt ſtricken cleane dead, by the ſword of the Spirit, which Saint <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 6.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.17.</note> calleth the <hi>Word of God:</hi> which wound was afterwards ſalued, but fully healed by that ſpirituall beaſt, which the 11. and 12. verſes of the 13. chapter of the <hi>Reuclation</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, roſe vp in the <hi>Roman</hi> kingdome, reſembling Chriſt the Lambe; for (as the Text ſaith,) <hi>He did all that the firſt beaſt could doe before him.</hi> Whereby hee brought the latter Domination ſo liuely to reſemble the former, as any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or image could poſſibly be made to reſemble any beaſt: therefore by the ſecond Domination vnder the <hi>Popes,</hi> is meant that image which Antichriſt ſhould make to ſpeake; that is, ſhould cauſe to publiſh, and proclaime, that as many as would not be conformable to all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh ordinances thereof, as in the former Domination, ſhould be killed. By which means it came to paſſe (as who ſo will reade the latter end of the thirteenth chapter ſhall ſee) that all were brought to be ſubiect to his Lore. Now therefore, whether we may vnderſtand this great worke, to be accompliſhed by a painted picture, or carued image, and that by that ſame image which Antichriſt ſhould make to ſpeake, ſhould be meant the image of ſome carnall beaſt, or whether this be not a meer carnall interpretation of theirs, let the diſcreete Reader iudge.</p>
                  <p n="23">23 Thirdly, he ſaith, <hi>Antichriſt ſhall faine himſelfe to die and riſe agayne:</hi> which thing, if any one of his places doe proue, I doe heere promiſe to recant. Wherefore, as the <hi>Popes</hi> not working thoſe three miracles (actually) are not thereby cleared from being Antichriſt; ſo do not theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles proue <hi>Bellarmines Iew</hi> to worke them, to proue him to be Antichriſt. Therefore let vs come to ſome further tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with them for the better finding out of Antichriſt, by the miracles which he ſhal work, in which no better courſe can be taken, then by ſearching out the place where he ſhal worke them: for if he ſhall worke them in that one City, or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8496:32"/>Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then it is likely he ſhall be a <hi>Iew;</hi> but if all the world ouer, in the Cities and Nations of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> then it is more likely he ſhall not be a <hi>Iew,</hi> but a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</hi>

The corporall Beaſt is diſciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſimilitude of an vgly Monſter, beeing in ſhape like vnto a <hi>Leopard,</hi> his feet like <hi>Beares</hi> feete, and his mouth as the mouth of a <hi>Lyon.</hi> The ſpirituall Beaſt is onely ſaid to haue two Hornes like the <hi>Lambe.</hi> Vnder the firſt Beaſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> was our Sauiour Chriſt, and all his Apoſtles put to death, as alſo many thouſand Chriſtians after them: and almoſt all the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the ſpace of neere three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares. This corporall Beaſt, was <hi>Heatheniſh Rome</hi> and Regiment, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would make the World
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8496:38"/>to beleeue, the Angel in the ſeauenteenth Chapter onely called <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The firſt Beaſt wee ſee, is ſet forth in a viſible ſhape, to our corporall eyes; the ſecond, in no ſhape, therefore to be diſcerned with ſpirituall eyes: onely it is ſaid to haue two Hornes like the <hi>Lambe:</hi> that is to ſay, to ſeeme to haue the two <hi>Testaments,</hi> the Law of God, and Goſpel of Chriſt, to be the onely ſtrength of his Kingdome, and Prieſthood, as Chriſt himſelfe had. By which it is certaine, that by this ſecond Beaſt (ſo reſembling Chriſt) is meant Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Regiment. Now the firſt beaſt, they confeſſe was well worthie the name of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for that it did as well reſemble old <hi>Babylon, (in tyranny, Idolatrie, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of abominations)</hi> as if it had beene the verie ſame: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if wee can prooue that the ſecond beaſt, became ſo liuely to reſemble the firſt beaſt, as the firſt beaſt did the firſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> then the caſe will ſtand cleare, that the ſecond beaſt is as well worthie the ſame name. Now for proofe hereof, what better Author can wee bring, then the Angel himſelfe, who of the ſecond beaſt ſaith thus,
<note n="*" place="margin">Some of our Writers haue doubted that, becauſe it is ſaid he did all that the firſt beaſt did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, or in his ſight: that this cannot be meant of the Popes ſpirituall Regiment; but the 20. verſe of the 19. Chap. will ſhew them it is.</note> 
                  <hi>And he did all that the first beaſt could doe before him, and he cauſed the Earth, and them that dwelt therein, to worſhip the firſt Beaſt:</hi> that is, commaunded all vpon the earth within his Dominions, to lay to their helping hands with him, to bring the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate into the firſt beaſts forme and order: and alſo to bring all the inhabitants, within his iuriſdiction, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues in reuerence and humble obedience vnto the ſame, and ſo to worſhip the firſt beaſt, in honouring his old <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Ordinances, by which it is without all contradiction: the ſecond beaſt is no whitleſſe worthie the ſame name.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But yet for more plainer proofe, that by the ſecond beaſt is meant the ſpirituall Regiment of Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> let vs heare how <hi>Eraſmus</hi> doth interpret thoſe words of the Angel in the thirteenth Chapter: his words bee theſe,
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 13. Chap. 5. Sect.</note> 
                  <hi>When as the Roman Kingdome, after the time of</hi> Iulianus, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be diuided into Eaſt and Weſt, and to diminiſh for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8496:38"/>then began a new Roman Kingdome and iuriſdiction, namely, the Popes pompe:</hi> And a little after,
<note n="b" place="margin">Jbidem.</note> 
                  <hi>This Kingdome of the Papists tooke vpon it all the power of the firſt beaſt, the Roman Emperour, and compelled the Chriſtians to Idolatrie and ſeruice of falſe gods, vnder a pretence of honouring Christ and Saints.</hi> By which it is moſt apparant, that by the ſecond beaſt is meant the Popiſh Chriſtian Regiment of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this is very ſufficient for the prouing, that by the two beaſts in the thirteenth Chapter, is meant the <hi>Heatheniſh Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Chriſtian Regiment. Now it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that we proue alſo, whether by the beaſt mentioned in the ſeauenteenth Chapter, which the Angel called, <hi>Babylon, the Mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth, bee meant Heatheniſh Rome,</hi> and her Regiment, vnder the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperours, or of Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> and of her Regiment vnder the <hi>Popes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hauing diſcourſed at large, of the matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and ſixteenth Chapters, comming to the ſeauenteenth Chapter, he ſaith thus,
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vpon then 7. chap. Sect. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>One of the ſeauen Angels, which ſpake of the ſecond Kingdome, and of the iuriſdiction of Rome, and of the beaſt with two Hornes, commeth now againe, and will ſpeake more plainely.</hi> So that he giueth vs to vnderſtand,
<note place="margin">The ſpirituall beaſt in the 13. chap. and that in the 17. chap. are one.</note> that the ſame beaſt in the thirteenth Chapter, and that in the ſeuenteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are both one. Now we heard before, by what ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent arguments hee proued, that by the ſecond beaſt was meant Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> and her Regiment; but let vs alſo ſee by what inducements he is lead, to affirme, that that beaſt in the ſeauenteenth Chapter is the ſame. The firſt motiue, I take to bee this; namely, for that the ſame beaſt, which the Angel in the fift verſe called <hi>Babylon, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whordomes and abominations of the Earth,</hi> in the 8. verſe, he ſaw, he had expounded to <hi>Iohn</hi> to be a Citie;
<note place="margin">Euident notes to proue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Rome</hi> Babylon.</note> and in the ninth verſe, to be that onely Citie, that compaſſeth within her ſeauen ſpeciall Hills; which was ſufficient to perſwade him, that by the beaſt in the ſeauenteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Angel meant <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, to induce him to vnderſtand, that the Angel meant Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſaw
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8496:39"/>the Angel ſpake of <hi>Romes</hi> eſtate in her latter daies: for that ſo ſoone as he had declared vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> the beaſt to bee a Citie, and with one and the ſame breath to adde theſe words; <hi>which raigneth ouer the Kings of the Earth:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for that he ſaw him to preuent <hi>Iohn</hi> before in the twelfth Verſe: for vnderſtanding them of Kings in his dayes, in ſaying thus of them: <hi>Which yet haue not receiued a kingdome, but ſhall receiue power at an houre with the beaſt.</hi> As alſo, for that by theſe very words, he declared vnto him, that he did not ſpeake of the firſt beaſt, becauſe that beaſt was then in his full power, and raigned ouer both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Thirdly, for that hee ſaw the Angell had declared vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> which afterwards ſhould riſe vp with the beaſt, ſhould continue with her to the end of her dayes, and ſhould grow into ſo great hatred againſt her, that they ſhould purſue her to her vtter deſtruction. For as in the twelfth verſe, he deſcribed thoſe <hi>Kings,</hi> by the ſimilitude of tenne hornes, ſo in the ſixteenth and ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſes, hee ſaid vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> thus of thoſe hornes: <hi>And the tenne Hornes which thou ſaweſt vpon the beaſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>are they that ſhall hate the Whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire, for God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to doe with one conſent, for to giue their kingdome vnto the beaſt, vntill the words of God be fulfilled.</hi> Fourthly, the fourth verſe of the ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, inforced him to vnderſtand the beaſt which the Angel there calleth <hi>Babylon, the Mother of whordomes and abominations of the Earth,</hi> to bee the Chriſtian ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> in her latter daies; for that the Angell there ſaid, Shee offered to the World <hi>the abomination and filthineſſe of her fornication, in a Golden Cup:</hi> that is (as the learned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it) her idolatries and whoriſh Doctrine and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the name of Chriſt: which cup <hi>Eraſmus</hi> declareth, <hi>Heatheniſh Rome,</hi> diſdayned once to handle, and abhorred what good ſoeuer was offered to her therein: therefore he could not otherwiſe vnderſtand, but that the Angel meant the Chriſtian Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in her latter dayes; which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8496:39"/>vnder the glittering and golden ſhew of the name of Chriſt, poyſoned a great part of Chriſtendome, with that whoriſh filthineſſe of her <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Fornication,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 18.3.</note> and the third verſe of the eighteenth Chapter. And thus wee ſee the foure principall poynts, which fully reſolued that moſt learned <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and may alſo as fully reſolue all men, that by <hi>Babylon, the Mother of whordomes and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Earth,</hi> the Angel meant Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> in her latter dayes. Now let vs heare how <hi>Eraſmus</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of Chriſtian <hi>Rome;</hi> thus he ſaith.</p>

<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 16. chap. Sect. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The whole order of Biſhops and multitude of Spirituaell Paſtours, which by their office and calling, ought to maintaine and ſupport the true Doctrine of God, haue bent themſelues, their whole life and ſtate, vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of the Goſpell, that nothing can bee more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the ſtate of the Apoſtles, in doctrine, religion, or life, then is their order and ſtate.</hi> Againe, he ſaith,
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vpon the 16. chap. Sect. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſecond beaſt with his two hornes, is twice as had as the first; for as much as through her two hornes, it had power both of bodie and ſoule, ouer the Doctrine, and ouer the politique Lawes, with mouth and hand against God, the temporall gouernement, Christ and his Miniſters.</hi> And againe he ſaith,
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vpon the 27. chap. Sect. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The bloud of the holy Prophets, and Preachers, hath this Whore (the Papacie) ſhed without meaſure, till ſhe was ſo drunke therewith, that ſhee tooke and esteemed her tyrannie for godly zeale.</hi> Therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with the very head of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church thus,
<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eraſmas</hi> in the words go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before.</note> 
                  <hi>For the name of the Christian Church, he hath deſerued ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother name, euen to be called the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all abominations, idolatrie, and of falling into Heatheniſh

                  <hi>I ſaw another Angel come downe from heauen, hauing great power, ſo that the Earth was lightened with his glorie, and he cryed out mightely with a loud voyce, ſaying: It is falne, it is falne, Babylon the great Citie, and is become the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of Diuels, and the hold of all foule ſpirits, and a cage of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vncleane and hatefull Bird: for all Nations haue drunke of of the Wine of the wrath of her Fornication, and the Kings of the Earth haue committed Fornication with her.</hi> Now wee heard before by the other Angel, that Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> therefore if this alſo be ſpoken of Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> then is Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi> ſo wonderfully falne, as that ſhe may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called <hi>Babylon.</hi> And that it may appeare indeed, that this Angel did alſo ſpeake of Chriſtian <hi>Rome,</hi> let vs heare how <hi>Eraſmus</hi> doth interpret his words, thus hee ſaith,

               <p n="6">6 Thirdly and laſtly, they ſay they are no Idolaters, for they receiued their manner of worſhipping God by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, from the tradition of the Apoſtles: wherein wee may note, firſt their blaſphemie; ſecondly, their ſhameleſneſſe, that baſh not to make thoſe bleſſed Apoſtles of Chriſt, the authors of their moſt damnable idolatrie. But as in this, ſo in many other principles of their religion, do they deale with thoſe holy ones; fathering all vpon their Traditions, be the things neuer ſo vile. But what will they anſwere? I ſuppoſe they will ſay, they are able to proue, that that ſame kinde of Doctrine was taught, and the ſame manner of worſhipping practiſed euen by the very Chriſtians, in the time of the Apoſtles, and we anſwere: We beleeue they are able, but withall, we beleeue alſo, that they are as well able to proue, how the ſame was approued of, among the Apoſtles. For albeit that <hi>Clement</hi> the firſt, and one of the ſeuenty Diſciples, teſtifieth, that ſome of the new conuerted
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8496:48"/>
                  <hi>Gentiles</hi> did ſo, and that in the very time of the Apoſtles; yet the ſame Diſciple teſtifieth alſo, how himſelfe did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of it, when writing to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle, for redreſſe, thus complained againſt it,
<note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Clement</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the Iuſt and Biſhop of Ieruſalem, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God by Images, came from the Diuell.</note> 
                  <hi>The diuell</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>by the mouth of others, vſeth to bring forth theſe words; Wee to the worſhip of the inuiſible God, worſhip the viſible Image.</hi> Now in that he ſaith, the diuell, this maketh the matter mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, how that doctrine of worſhipping God by Images, was not approued of among the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt: and alſo that it came from the diuells ſuggeſtions, and not from the Apoſtles traditions. Wherefore this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly conuicteth the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of moſt horrible impietie, in fathering this diuelliſh deuice vpon the holy Apoſtles of Chriſt. And the rather, becauſe they cannot poſſibly be ignorant, that it was brought into the Church by thoſe new conuerts, which were not then cleane remoued from their olde <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> ſuperſtition, and condemned by the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, for diuelliſh and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Furthermore, it is cleare, that if this argument could haue held good, namely, that becauſe thoſe new conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtians, ſuppoſed, that as they had vſed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their falſe gods by Images, ſo they ſhould worſhip the true God by Images, and that this their practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the time of the Apoſtles, that therefore it was a tradition of the Apoſtles: then might wee alſo conclude, that becauſe certaine <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and others of the Prophets) vſed the like, it was a tradition of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and other of the Prophets: but how <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and the Prophets did approue of their doings, all thoſe iudgements which they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, for ſo doing, doth plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, through out the old Teſtament, as we ſhall ſee anon, by the places which wee will cite: but in the meane while let vs ſee how the ancient Fathers approued of it, after the Apoſtles.</p>

               <p n="2">2 But now to caſt a muſt before the eyes of the ignorant, they come in with this blinde diſtinction, and ſay.

                  <note place="margin">The B. of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> no more ſought to exclude all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops, then the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> euer did.</note> who would haue had none other in all Chriſtendome but himſelfe.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8496:52"/>then might he in ſome one <hi>Epistle</hi> or other, haue charged him therewith, but we finde not any ſuch matter: neither in any of theſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> doth hee charge him with any ſuch thing; onely he condemneth him of arrogancy, for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe before all other Biſhops, and for ſeeking to bring them into ſuch ſubiection vnder him, as whereby he might haue raigned ouer them, as Lord and King. And euen herein onely was it, that hee charged him to imitate <hi>Lucifer.</hi> Therefore this diſtinction of titles, is but a meere miſty matter.

For in what booke or Chapter of the Scriptures doe they find that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was euer called, <hi>Our Lord God the Pope. An vndoubted and true God on earth. Not a pure man, but a true God:</hi> as we proued in our firſt Chapter, and ſecond Section, the <hi>Pope</hi> is called? Or, where find they that any one of all the Apoſtles, euer called <hi>Peter, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings:</hi> Or <hi>Supreame head of the vniuerſall Church:</hi> or that <hi>Peter</hi> euer called the Church his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> doth? If they cannot ſhew ſo much as any one place to proue it, what reaſon haue we to beleeue it. Therefore, foraſmuch as we finde vniuerſall <hi>Popes,</hi> not to be the ſucceſſours of <hi>S.

               <p n="16">16 Well then, all things being made cleare, that before there was a Church planted at <hi>Rome,</hi> there was a Chriſtian Church, which had then none other vniuerſall head but Chriſt, and that ſeeing the Church which wee haue now, doth acknowledge none other head; who can iuſtly denie our Church to be a true member of the moſt ancient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Church?

               <p n="5">5 But now in that it is ſaid, <hi>They lay dead three dayes and an halfe:</hi> and in the words following: <hi>After three dayes and an halfe the ſpirite of life comming from God, ſhall enter into them, and they ſhall ſtand vpon their feete:</hi> This is to be vnderſtood of the time, from the killing the laſt of the witneſſes, to the riſing againe of the firſt of them, and not of the 1260. dayes, the whole time of Antichriſts reigne, mentioned in the third verſe of the 11. chapter of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> as ſome doe vnderſtand it: for it is very abſurd to ſay, that the witneſſes ſhould lie dead, during the whole time of their prophecying, and yet prophecie too. Now for that we finde that the next that roſe after their death, to oppoſe themſelues againſt Antichriſt, and to ſet vp the Goſpell againe in his kingdome, was that man of God <hi>Luther:</hi> therefore in him did the two witneſſes firſt begin to riſe againe: for it is cleare, it is not meant, that the ſame ſhould riſe againe in their owne perſons, but that euen as <hi>Elias</hi> was reuiued in Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> (not in the ſame perſon,

Wherefore (chriſtian Reader) whenſoeuer they ſhall hereafter demaund of thee, where our Church was before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, anſwer them thus. It was by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Greats confeſsion ſixe hundred and fiue yeeres before there was an vniuerſall <hi>Pope,</hi> to make a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church: hauing then none other, but onely the ſame vniuerſall head, that now the true Chriſtian Catholique and vniuerſall Church hath, of which we are now apart: and that afterwards, when an vniuerſall <hi>Pope</hi> was ordained, and made ſupreame head of the Church, and had gotten dominion ouer the <hi>Weſt</hi> part thereof, yet euen there was our Church in reaſonable qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, till about foure hundred yeares, when as <hi>Pope Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> began to be a fire-brand. For indeed about that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8496:66"/>time, Antichriſt began to lay himſelfe open to the world, by his tyrannie which he began then to exerciſe againſt thoſe that did withſtand him: and afterwards when as hee was growing vp to the full meaſure of iniquitie, and that our Church (among them) could no longer beare his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable enormities, then during the next fiue hundred yeares following (through their grieuous perſecutions) it was driuen into holes and corners; and as many as they found, they deſtroyed, and the reſt would haue deſtroyed, had they not fled into thoſe other parts of our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, where they were preſerued by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, from the ſonne of perditions tyrannie, according to the propheſie in the fourteenth verſe of the twelfth Chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which ſaith: <hi>But to the woman, (to wit,</hi> the true Church) <hi>were giuen two wings of the great Eagle, that ſhee might flie into the wilderneſſe, into her place, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and halfe a time, from the preſence of the Serpent.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 Firſt then, whereas they ſay that Chriſt made Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Prince and head of all the Apoſtles; this may eaſily be proued a fable, becauſe there is nothing in all the Scriptures made more manifeſt, then Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> hath made it to the contrary.
<note place="margin">Luke 22.23.24.25.26.</note> For as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> declareth, that there was a ſtrife riſen among the Apoſtles about principalitie and ſupreame dignity, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enquire among themſelues, <hi>which of them ſhould ſeeme to be the greateſt.</hi> So Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that when their Maſter Chriſt perceiued whereabout they went, he did not make ſo light a matter of it, as to giue them leaue to determine it among themſelues, but with great care, he called them vnto him, and ſate downe; and as they all ſtood before him,
<note place="margin">Matthew 20, 25.26.</note> he decided their queſtion (according to Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> thus,) <hi>Ye know that the Lords of the Gentiles
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8496:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>haue domination ouer them, and they that are great exerciſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer them: but it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoeuer will be great among you, let him be your ſeruant.</hi> According to Saint <hi>Marke</hi> thus:

                  <hi>If any deſire to be firſt, the ſame ſhall be laſt of all, and ſeruant vnto all.</hi> So that by this wee ſee it very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that Chriſt allowed no ſupremacy or principality at all among the Apoſtles; therefore the <hi>Popes</hi> principality, and ſupremacy which he challengeth from <hi>Peters</hi> authority, is fabulous. For it is cleare, that if Chriſt would haue had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him any ſuch ſingular vniuerſall head, ouer his Church; now, by reaſon of this preſent occaſion, had been the onely time to haue made it knowne: but in that he ſaid in ſo plaine and expreſſe words, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you;</hi> he made it plaine to the contrary. Hence it was that Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed theſe words of Chriſt, and alſo the words of <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, againſt that falſe challenge of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſaying:

                  <hi>Peter could not giue that he had not; did he giue Lordſhip? heare what he ſaith: Not as ouer Gods heritage, but being a patterne to the flocke. And leaſt</hi> (ſaid he to the <hi>Pope</hi>) <hi>thou thinke it to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken onely in humility and not in truth; it is the voyce of the Lord in the Goſpell.

               <p n="3">3 Secondly, they ſay, <hi>To Peter onely Chriſt committed the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen.</hi> For the clearing of which point, we are firſt to make knowne what thoſe Keyes are; for by that the moſt ignorant may the more eaſily iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the reſt of the Apoſtles, Chriſt did not alſo giue the Keyes.
<note place="margin">Luke 11.52.</note> Chriſt himſelfe in the 11. <hi>Chapter</hi> of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell,
<note place="margin">Matthew 16.19.</note> declareth the firſt key to be Knowledge: and in the 16. <hi>Chapter</hi> of Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell, the ſecond to be Power. For the firſt key (<hi>to wit,</hi> knowledge) it is cleare by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 17.
<note place="margin">Iohn 17.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Goſpell, that Chriſt gaue it as well to the other Apoſtles, as to <hi>Peter.</hi> For in praying
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8496:76"/>for them all in generall, he vttered theſe words to his Father: <hi>I haue giuen thy words vnto them which thou gaueſt me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 15.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and they haue receiued them.</hi> Againe, <hi>Chapter</hi> 15. ſpeaking to all his Apoſtles in generall, he ſaid. <hi>All things that I haue heard of my Father, haue I made knowne vnto you.</hi> Likewiſe in the 14.
<note place="margin">Iohn 14.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſpeaking to them all in generall, he ſaid: <hi>Theſe things haue I ſpoken vnto you being preſent with you, but the comforter which is the holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance which I haue told you:</hi> So that hereby it plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that Chriſt gaue this firſt key to all the Apoſtles in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and therefore not to <hi>Peter</hi> alone.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Now touching the ſecond key, namely, the power of binding and looſing, remitting and retaining ſinnes, it is as cleare, that Chriſt gaue it indifferently to all the Apoſtles.
<note place="margin">Matthew 16.19.</note> For as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> in his 16. <hi>Chapter</hi> ſheweth, that he ſaid to <hi>Peter; Whatſoeuer thou bindeſt on earth, ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and whatſoeuer thou looſeſt in earth, ſhall be looſed in heauen:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.18.</note> ſo in the 18. Chapter he declareth, that Chriſt ſpake theſe very ſame words to all the Apoſtles, ſaying: <hi>Whatſoeuer ye bind in earth, ſhall be bound in heauen; and whatſoeuer ye looſe in earth, ſhall be looſed in heauen.</hi> And likewiſe Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 20. Chapter witneſſeth, that he ſaid alſo to them all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ſoeuer ye remit, they are remitted vnto them;</hi>

                  <hi>whoſe ſinnes ye retaine, they are retained.</hi> Therefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that Chriſt gaue this key alſo to all the other Apoſtles as well as to <hi>Peter.</hi> And therefore it is which Saint <hi>Origine</hi> ſaith;

                  <hi>This ſaying, to thee will I giue the Keyes, is common to all the reſt of the Apostles; and the words that follow, as ſpoken to Peter, are common to all.</hi> Likewiſe Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith;

               <p n="5">5 Thou knoweſt (Chriſtian Reader) that the vſe of Keyes, are to open and to ſhut; to let in, and to keepe out ſuch as are not meete to come in.

Now that wee may ſee alſo whereunto it tendeth, and know the better how to anſwer vnto it, let vs obſerue their owne definition: thus they define it.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:8496:88"/>A propitiatory Sacrifice; a Sacrifice to ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for ſinne, and to reconcile him and his people together, by the daily, or often offering the body of Chriſt for the ſinnes of the quicke and dead.</q>
               <p n="4">4 Now touching this definition, wee are aduiſedly to conſider how it can poſſibly ſtand with the truth; for if it be of neceſſity vnto ſaluation, to haue the body of Chriſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or oftentimes offered for ſinne; then is it certaine, that Chriſt by the Sacrifice of his death vpon the Croſſe, did not take it away: and then are all theſe Scriptures confounded, which denie it needfull to haue any more oblations for ſinne, or the body of Chriſt any more offered for the ſame: namely, where the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chapter</hi> 10.14.
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.14. Heb. 10.1. Heb. 9.26.</note> 
                  <hi>For with one oblation hath he conſecrated for euer them that be ſanctified:</hi> and where hee alſo ſaith, <hi>Chapter</hi> 10.10. <hi>We are ſanctified euen by the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once made:</hi> and againe, where he further ſaith, <hi>Chapter</hi> 9.26. <hi>Now in the end of the World hath hee appeared once to put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.18.</note> and alſo where he concludeth of this point thus, <hi>Chapter</hi> 10.18. <hi>Where remiſſion of theſe things is, there is no more offering for ſinne.</hi> Wherefore if it be true, that of neceſſity Chriſt muſt continually be offered for ſinne; then are theſe teſtimonies moſt vntrue: but in that they are yea, and Amen, they moſt truly declare the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of their <hi>Maſſe</hi> to be falſe, and that the neceſſity of daily ſacrificing for ſinne, is not grounded vpon the truth. Alſo ſeeing that vnder the Goſpell, there muſt not onely be but one onely oblation for ſinne, but alſo but once offered, and that by Chriſt himſelfe; the Papiſts are condemned for notorious heretikes, that will haue ſo many thouſand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ſo many times offered by others, For doe they not thereby make that one Sacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, as inſufficient for the taking away of ſinne, as the daily ſacrificing the bodies of beaſts, and ſhedding the bloud of Calues in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, which were daily offered, becauſe they ſerued onely for ſinnes paſt, and not for ſinnes to come,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8496:88"/>and therefore as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 10. <hi>made nothing perfect?</hi> Wherefore who ſeeth not, but that the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging into the Church the neceſſity of daily ſacrificing for ſinne, bringeth in with it the vtter ouerthrow of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Chriſts death and bloud-ſhedding. But foraſmuch as the holy Ghoſt (ſpeaking of the daily offering of Chriſt for ſinne) ſaith <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 7.27. <hi>Which needed not daily, as thoſe high Priests, to offer vp ſacrifice, firſt for his owne ſinnes, and then for the peoples; for that did he once when he offered vp himſelfe:</hi> their daily ſacrificing for ſinne, is not onely ſuperfluous and vaine, but alſo moſt hereticall and blaſphemous.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But what ſhall we ſay now, haue they nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere? yea verily, for thus in effect they ſay:

                  <hi>We acknowledge and confeſſe, that Chriſt by the ſacrifice of his death, freed vs from the guilt of originall ſinne</hi> (that is, from that one ſinne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) but for the malediction of all our actuall tranſgreſſions, that to be taken away by the bleſſed ſacrifice of the Maſſe:</hi> which being true, then are wee more beholden to their ſacrifice, then to Chriſts ſacrifice. For if Chriſt by his ſacrifice, tooke away onely the guilt of that one ſinne, and left vs guilty of many thouſand ſinnes; what hath he done for vs? but the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi>

But how true it is, that Chriſt by the ſacrifice of his death and bloud-ſhedding, cleanſed vs but from that one ſinne onely, theſe words of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> will make it plaine, where hee ſaith, 1 <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Chapter,</hi> 7 <hi>verſe.

                  <note place="margin">Titus 2 chap. 14 verſe.</note> 
                  <hi>He redeemed vs from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:</hi> and likewiſe theſe words, where hee ſpeaking of our condemnation by originall ſinne, and the reſtoring vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by Chriſt, ſaith; <hi>Romans</hi> 5 <hi>Chapter,</hi> 16 <hi>verſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Againe, if it be true, that the ſuffering and death of Chriſt, ſerued but for the healing the wound of originall ſinne, and not alſo for our actuall tranſgreſſions; then is not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8496:89"/>this true which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chapter</hi> 43.5. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for our iniquities; the chastiſement of our peace was vpon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Therefore it is very cleare, that if the Papiſts doctrine be true, the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles are meerely falſe. But if we ſhall beleeue them, that Chriſt by his ſacrifice vpon the Croſſe, did ſatisfie the wrath and iuſtice of God, for one part; and they by their ſacrifice vpon the Altar for another part, and ſo Chriſt with them, and they with Chriſt, as fellow-helpers and copartners toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe fully ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice for all ſinne; how ſhall we beleeue the Prophet in another place? where (in the perſon of Chriſt) he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eſay 63.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> 63.3. <hi>I haue trodden the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe alone, and of all people there is none with me.</hi> Or, that which the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith of Chriſt,

                  <hi>Chapter</hi> 9.26. <hi>He hath put away ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.</hi> Wherefore as I ſaid, if we muſt imbrace their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for truth, then muſt we reiect the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles as erroneous.

                  <hi>The Lord remaineth alone; for no man can be partner with God in forgiuing of ſinnes, this is Chriſts onely office, that hath taken away the ſinnes of the World.</hi> Therefore to reſtraine the power of Chriſts ſacrifice to that onely one ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſo the multitude of our tranſgreſſions might be done away by the ſacrifice of their <hi>Maſſe,</hi> is vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the proper prerogatiue of Chriſt, and the whole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his death and paſſion, in which the matter of remiſſion of ſinnes, iuſtification, and ſaluation, doth onely conſiſt.

                  <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 1.22. <hi>In the bodie of his fleſh through death, he made vs holy and vnblameable, and without fault in the ſight of God: and ſet at peace, through the bloud of his Croſſe, both the things in earth, and the things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Wherefore to bring in any other ſacrifice for ſinne, but onely the oblation of Chriſts body broken, and his bloud ſhed, and that offered by himſelfe once for all; is vtterly to ouerthrow all whatſoeuer Chriſt hath done for mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;

                  <hi>Except ye eate the fleſh of the Son of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> Thirdly, he would they ſhould haue perceiued, that as he was both God and man, ſo it was alſo of as great a neceſſity vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould feede on both his natures vnitedly together.

                  <hi>He that eateth me, euen he ſhall liue by me.</hi> By which we ſee it euident and plaine, that none can be ſaued, but thoſe that doe eate Chriſt; not onely as hee is God, but alſo as hee is man; and alſo as he is both God and man.

<note place="margin">To eate &amp; feed on Chriſts fleſh, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that by the ſuffering in his fleſh, hee tooke away the ſinne of our fleſh.</note> and that he that did eate thereof, ſhould not die; they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: but when he added further, and ſaid; <hi>And the bread that I will giue, is my fleſh, which I will giue for the life of the World, of which whoſoeuer ſhall eate, ſhall haue euerlasting life;</hi> they raged and murmured among themſelues, ſaying. <hi>How can this man giue vs his fleſh to eate? This is an hard ſaying; who can heare it?</hi> But when our Sauiour perceiued their carnall vnderſtanding, in which they ſo groſſely erred in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating, by imagining they ſhould haue eaten him with their mouthes and teethes, as their Fathers did eate <hi>Manna;</hi> then in the 58. verſe fully to reſolue them, that he meant no ſuch kinde of eating, he ſaid.
<note place="margin">The Iewes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating, could profit nothing by the matter they ſhould eate.</note> 
                  <hi>Not as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eate Manna.</hi> And yet more fully to reſolue them, that indeede he meant a ſpirituall kinde of eating; in the 57. verſe he ſaid plainely thus: <hi>As the liuing Father hath ſent me, ſo liue I by the Father, and he that eateth me, euen he ſhall liue by me.</hi> By which words he declared vnto them, that as he did not liue carnally by the Father, but ſpiritually; ſo ſhould they liue ſpiritually by him. Howbeit,
<note place="margin">The cauſe was, they would none of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.</note> ſuch was their peruerſeneſſe, that they would none of his interpretations, but becauſe he had ſaid, they muſt eate his God-head, they would no otherwiſe vnderſtand, but that hee meant, they ſhould eate it carnally; and alſo becauſe hee had ſaid they muſt eate his man-hood, they would no otherwiſe, but that they ſhould eate his fleſh corporally: then ſaid Chriſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto them, <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing:</hi> Meaning as they vnderſtood it ſhould bee
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8496:92"/>eaten; for otherwiſe his fleſh was as profitable as his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (vnto thoſe that did eate it after that manner as hee meant) elſe would he not haue ſaid. <hi>Whoſoeuer eateth my fleſh, hath eternall life: and except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> But therefore they failing in the manner, could profit nothing by the matter they ſhould eate,
<note place="margin">The manner wherein they erred, Chriſt himſelfe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Verſe 64.</note> and the manner wherein they failed, hee declared in the 64. verſe, was, becauſe they did not eate him ſpiritually by faith. For ſaid he: <hi>But there are ſome of you which beleeue not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Thus then we may be fully reſolued, that the manner of eating which Chriſt meant, was ſpiritually by faith, which hee made plaine vnto them, not onely in that 64. verſe, but almoſt throughout the whole Chapter: for wee may there ſee, that whenſoeuer he ſpake of eating; ſtill hee added beleeuing; onely to manifeſt vnto them, that by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<note place="margin">Eating and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, is both but one thing.</note> he meant beleeuing. Alſo that they might the more plainely haue vnderſtood, that by eating and beleeuing, he meant but one, and one onely thing, he expounded it vnto them, by that one onely effect, which he declared, both ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and beleeuing hath. For as in the 54. verſe, he ſaid: <hi>Whoſoeuer eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> So in the 40. verſe he ſaid: <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that whoſoeuer ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeueth in him, ſhould haue euerlasting life; and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing he ſhewed them ſo plainely, that the effect of eating and beleeuing, was but one and the ſame thing, they might the more eaſily haue vnderſtood, that by eating and beleeuing, he meant but onely one and the ſame thing; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that they ſhould eate him ſpiritually by faith, and not after a carnall and corporall manner.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And thus (Chriſtian Reader) haue we found out the true meaning of thoſe words of Chriſt, touching the eating and feeding on him: euen by conferring place with place, and verſe with verſe; which is doubtleſſe the moſt ſureſt way for the bringing the truth to light, euen by expounding one Scripture by another. For as Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith;

                  <hi>For otherwiſe we are not able to reach the truth.</hi> And a little after. <hi>This Church ſtandeth of them, that declare by ſenſible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tokens, that they be partakers of Chriſt, as they be, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt to be the Sonne of God. And therefore this Church hath certaine holy tokens, or Sacraments, ordained to that end, that thereby we may know them that be of Chriſt, ſo farre forth as by ſuch tokens coniectured knowledge may be gathered. Therefore I ſay, That this Church of Chriſt, by this coniecturall iudgement is counted holy, notwithstanding wicked men, and hypocrites couer themſelues vnder the ſame outward tokens.</hi> And what thoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens are, he expreſſeth in theſe words following: <hi>And receiue Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, as well as the godly.</hi> And thus much for this point. Now let vs ſee what we can ſay to the Sacrament of the Altar, or <hi>Maſſe.</hi> And thus we ſee that thoſe words of Chriſt, are ſpiritually to be vnderſtood, and not carnally, as the <hi>Papists</hi> vnderſtand them: neither doe I ſee how they can properly apply thoſe words to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that we ſee, the ſcope and drift of Chriſt, was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, to draw them to the knowledge of him, as he then was, <hi>to wit,</hi> both God and man, and that he being God, was become man, to ſatisfie the wrath and iuſtice of God for man, in the ſame fleſh that man had offended in, that ſo they might haue beleeued, that he was the ſame <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Sauiour, foretold by <hi>Moſes,</hi> on whom they did relie: but no one word of the Sacrament: therefore it ſeemeth to me, thoſe words doe not directly concerne the Sacrament, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall eating. And the rather alſo may they be of my minde, for that theſe of their owne ſide, haue thus written, <hi>Michael vehe</hi>

                  <hi>That ſaying hath no foundation, or warrant in the words written by Saint Iohn. Therefore to ſpeake of the receiuing of the Sacrament, in true vnderſtanding, it hath no force.</hi> And a little after. <hi>For this was ſpoken long before the Sacrament was ordained. Therefore out of thoſe words, they can make no good proofe, touching the communion of the Sacrament, ſeeing the Sacrament at that time had no being.</hi> Wherefore let
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8496:94"/>vs now come to the words, which properly and directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to the Sacrament, or Sacramentall eating. Which when Chriſt deliuered the Sacrament to his Apoſtles, were theſe.

               <p n="8">8 Now touching theſe words (Chriſtian Reader) which they would haue alſo litterally to be taken, and not figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely to be vnderſtood, it will plainely appeare, that they are but figuratiue ſpeeches.

For therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe we goe to a King by tribunes, and Noble men; becauſe the King is a man, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not whom he may be ſure to truſt.</hi> And indeed for diuers cauſes, it is not meete that euery man ſhould haue free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe into the Kings priuy Chamber, and chiefly for feare of treaſon againſt his perſon, as experience doth plainely teach vs; and as no doubt it would ſoone be ſeene, if our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocators of Saints might haue free paſſage. Neuertheleſſe,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8496:97"/>where is there any ſuch decree made, that no man may ſpeake to the King, but by ſome Noble man? Doth not the King allow any man or woman to deliuer their Petitions vnto him with their owne hands, whereſoeuer they meete him? and is there any other decree made by God, to debar any from deliuering their Petitions vnto him by their mouth? Therefore what ground of truth haue they, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre men from going to God, without hauing ſome one Saint or other, to be their Aduocate, Mediatour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour?</p>

               <p n="5">5 <hi>Theophilact</hi> writing vpon the ſame words of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith thus:

                  <hi>That the Mediatour ſhould be the Sonne of God it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, for he ſhould be the reconciliation and perfect mediatour, for he is a mediatour of two: for hee put himſelfe as a meane or middle thing, to ioyne contrary things together. Therefore he is the Sonne of God, and Mediatour of men; for he is partaker of both natures.</hi> And hereof it is which Saint <hi>Chriſostome</hi> ſaith:

                  <hi>Chriſt Ieſus is Mediatour betweene God and man, not onely becauſe he hath reconciled man vnto God; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is naturally and ſubstantially both God and man in one perſon.

<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1 Chap. 19 verſe. 2 Theſ. 2. ch. 8.</note> he meant the truth, the light whereof Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth, <hi>The day-ſtarre,</hi> 2. <hi>Epistle,</hi> 1. <hi>Chapter.</hi> And the power thereof, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2. <hi>Chapter</hi> 8, calleth the <hi>Spirit of Gods mouth,</hi> wherewith he ſheweth, that Antichriſt, and all Antichriſtian Teachers, and their doctrine, ſhall be conſumed, euen as fire conſumeth the droſſe, and fineth the gold and ſiluer. And therefore in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> where hee ſpeaketh of purging by fire, (that no man ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him to meane a corporall or materiall fire) hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth of that matter thus:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>As it were by the fire.</hi> That is, as it were by fire, the vaine doctrine ſhall be burned and conſumed by the fire of Gods truth, and the Teacher there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being tryed thereby to hold the foundation ſound, the Church ſhall not condemne him as an heretique, but ſaue his life. For if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould haue ſpoken thoſe words, to haue maintained a place of purging ſinne; then ſhould hee haue vtterly confounded all his owne doctrine, throughout all his <hi>Epistles,</hi> where he ſo laboureth to proue, that our ſins are wholly purged by the bloud of Chriſt onely. For firſt, in the third <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſaith thus of Chriſt: <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.25. Rom. 5.9.</note> And in his 5. <hi>Chapter</hi> thus: <hi>Being now iustified by his bloud, we ſhall be ſaued from wrath through him.</hi> And in the firſt to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> thus:
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkeneſſe, and hath tranſlated vs into the Kingdome of his deare Sonne, in whom wee haue redemption through his bloud, that is, the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> And in the ſame <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>

Therefore it is cleare, that thoſe his words in the third Chapter to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> cannot be vnderſtood of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

               <p n="9">9 Furthermore, as touching the truth of this doctrine, namely, that our ſinnes are waſhed and cleanſed onely by the bloud of Chriſt, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is not ſingular in this point: for as we heard before out of the ſeauenth Chapter of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> that it was confirmed to Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> by the Angell of God from Heauen; ſo likewiſe whoſoeuer will reade the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of that Booke, ſhall finde theſe words ſet downe concerning Chriſt: <hi>

                  <hi>Purgatory;</hi> whereas we ſee, that it was not poſſible for any of them to ſpeake more directly and expreſly with it, then theſe their teſtimonies are againſt it; and that howſoeuer that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie (mingled with the truth) did wonderfully confound ſome of their iudgements, ſo as that the beſt learned of them, could ſcarcely tell how to conclude of the matter; yet theſe their teſtimonies may abſolutely reſolue vs, how wee are to conclude thereof. Neuertheleſſe, let men vary neuer ſo much, the truth is conſonant and agreeable to it ſelfe; neither neede any to differ therein, if they will ſquare their doctrine by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, <hi>Romans</hi> 12. namely,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.</note> that it agree with the true proportion and analogy of faith: But how this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> doth agree therewith, theſe three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, collected out of the ſaid Booke of <hi>Doctor Fulkes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Maſter <hi>Allen,</hi> will make it plaine.

<note place="margin">The doctrine of Purgatory againſt the faith.</note> let the diſcreet Reader iudge.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. The concluſion of the former twelue Chapters: Containing an anſwere vnto two ſorts of Papiſts: the one, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that we are iuſtified and ſaued by the workes of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8496:107"/>of the Law: the other, that wee are ſaued by faith and workes together. That becauſe no man can fulfill the Law, no man can be iuſtified by the Law. That God was not vniuſt in giuing ſuch a Law, as he knew no man was able to fulfill. That to ſeeke to merit ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the high way to damnation.</head>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O farre and wide (Chriſtian Reader) as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> iuriſdiction and Kingdome of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> did extend it ſelfe, this Doctrine of iuſtification by faith without the workes of the Law, was impugned. Some teaching that men by their good workes are iuſtified, and for their good workes ſaued. Others that we are iuſtified and ſaued, by faith and workes together: to both which we anſwere.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All good workes, are ſaid to be the workes of the Law, becauſe God commaunded them in his Law, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers good ends and purpoſes: the iuſtification by which, confiſteth of two parts. Firſt, in not omitting any one thing, whatſoeuer the Law hath commanded: Secondly, in not committing any one thing whatſoeuer the Law hath forbidden: which as it is in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> the eighteenth Chapter;
<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.5.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man doe, he ſhall liue in them.</hi> But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he doe not obſerue and doe all, and alſo doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary; hee is ſo farre from being iuſtified by the Law, that he is accurſed and condemned by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The affirmatiue part is proued in the ſeauen and twentieth Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 27.26.</note> Where it is ſaid, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be hee that confirmeth not all the wordes of this Law to doe them, and all the people ſhall ſay: So be it.</hi> The negatiue part is proued,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.11.13</note> 
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Chap. 18. in theſe words. <hi>If he doe any one of theſe things, though he doe not all, ſhall he liue? ſeeing he hath done all theſe abhominations, he ſhall ſurely die the death.</hi> By which it is cleare, that whoſoeuer omitteth any one thing which the Law requireth, or committeth any one thing whatſoeuer the Law prohibiteth, hee is culpable of the whole. And this is it which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8496:107"/>Chapter 2. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall keepe the whole Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iames 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and yet faileth in one poynt, is guiltie of all.</hi> Therefore now the queſtion is, whether any man can thus abſolutely fulfill the Law? Wee ſay, no man can: Contrariwiſe the Papiſts ſay, that a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man may. And their Doctor Maſter <hi>Harding,</hi> will proue it both by the words of Chriſt, and alſo of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">M. <hi>Harding</hi> in Apol. chap. 19. Diuiſ. 1.</note> The words of Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 11. after their Tranſlation, be theſe: <hi>My yoke is ſweete, and my burden light.</hi> And the words of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Epistle,</hi> 5. <hi>Chapter,</hi> be theſe: <hi>His Commandements be not heauy.</hi> Now the words of Chriſt, that goe before thoſe his words, be theſe: <hi>Come vnto me all ye that are weary and laden, and I will eaſe you:</hi> And then it followeth: <hi>Take my yoke vpon you, &amp;c.</hi> Shewing, that if any were afflicted in his conſcience, and found himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for his ſinne by the Law, he ſhould not deſpaire; becauſe hee himſelfe had fulfilled the Law for him: and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 2.
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.14. Coloſ. 1.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Hath put out the hand-writing that was againſt him.</hi> And thereby <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Hath made him vnblameable, and without fault in the ſight of God.</hi> So that hee hauing made the Law ſo light a burden vnto him, as that, although he cannot but breake it, yet it ſhall not condemne him, nor preſſe him downe to hell; the ſpirituall taſte where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt needs be ſweete vnto him. And this I take to be the true ſenſe and meaning of Chriſt. For if Chriſt had meant, that the Law had beene eaſie for vs to fulfill, then could we haue disburdened our ſelues of our ſinnes, and needed not at all to goe for any eaſe to him.
<note place="margin">1 Epiſt. 5.3.</note> And whereas Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith (after their Tranſlation) <hi>His Commandements be not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.</hi> If he did meane that a regenerate man can actually and abſolutely fulfill the Law, then it is cleare, he did meane that a regenerate man may be without ſinne: but then how doth this agree with his owne words? <hi>Chapter</hi> 1. where he ſaith of himſelfe, and ſuch as himſelfe then was:
<note place="margin">1 Epiſt. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>If wee ſay wee haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth it is not in vs.</hi> And <hi>Chapter</hi> 3. <hi>Sinne is the tranſgreſsion of the Law.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Epiſt. 3.4.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee did not meane that a regenerate man can fulfill the whole Law. And that indeede it may appeare yet more plainly, they cannot; let vs ſee what wee can proue by the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8496:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> Fathers, and their owne Writers.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, Romans</hi> 7 <hi>Chapter, verſes</hi> 14.15. deſcribing in his owne perſon the ſtate of all the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ſaith: <hi>For we know that the Law is ſpirituall, but I am carnall,</hi>

Now to him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fauour, but by debt: but to him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is accounted for righteous: Euen as Dauid declareth the bleſſedneſſe of the man, vnto whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without workes, ſaying: Bleſſed are they whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered: Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne.</hi> So that hereby we ſee it moſt manifeſt, that iuſtification before God, conſiſteth in faith alone without workes: euen as he alſo proueth as apparantly, where he abſolutely, and vtterly excludeth all kinde of workes; for being wholly, or any part of the cauſe of iuſtification, in that he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes: If it be of workes, it is no more of grace.</hi> That

<note place="margin">Iames 1.22.</note> And therefore it is that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers onely, deceiuing your owne ſelues.</hi> By which wee ſee it euident and plaine, that not preaching, but practiſing; not hearing, but doing, is that that can aſſure a man, that he hath that true and iuſtifying faith. And that not all in like meaſure: for it will not be accepted of God, that he which hath receiued Gods gifts in a great meaſure, ſhould doe no more, and be no more bountifull then hee that receiued them in a ſmall meaſure. And therefore it is that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Epiſtle of Peter 4.10.</note> 4 <hi>Chap. Let euery man as he hath receiued the gift; miniſter the ſame one to another, as good diſpoſers of the manifold graces of God. If any man ſpeake, let him talke as the words of God.

               <p n="17">17 And now to returne to our aduerſaries: thus I ſay; that foraſmuch as this being the generall doctrine of our Church, that none can be ſaued by ſuch a faith as is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good workes, they doe vs manifeſt wrong, in charging vs to teach againſt good workes, and that we are ſaued by an idle faith that hath no workes: whereas we ſay, that we are
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8496:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>iuſtified and ſaued by the faith which hath good workes, but without the workes; becauſe faith onely doth apprehend the matter of our iuſtification, which is not poſſible for workes to doe. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>Be it knowne vnto you men and brethren, that through this man is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto you the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and from all things from which ye could not be iustified by the Law of Moſes, by him enery one that beleeueth, is iustified.</hi> Many when they heare vs ſpeake of iuſtification, doe not conſider the point: for they ſuppoſe that wee ſpeake of the matter, when indeede wee ſpeake onely of the meanes. For to ſpeake properly of the matter, it is neither faith of it ſelfe, nor faith and workes together, that doth iuſtifie vs before GOD: but as we ſee, it is Chriſt Ieſus onely of himſelfe, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that doth both iuſtifie and ſaue.</p>
               <p>But as touching the meanes, wee ſay it is faith alone. And hereof it is which Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaking both of the matter and the meanes, ſaith:

               <p n="18">18 Now then (Chriſtian Reader) this doctrine of iuſtification by faith in Chriſt, without workes, being ſo eaſie and clearely to bee proued the truth; is it not a Worlds wonder, to ſee that ſo many wiſe and learned men, ſhould impugne it: And that a Cardinall, one of the Popes Pen-men, Maſter <hi>Allen,</hi> ſhould aſcribe ſo much vnto good workes, as to ſay:

Neither will they doe their good workes, to the end whereunto God ordained and appointed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8496:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>them to be done, as we doe. Firſt, to ſhew our loue to God, in walking as it becommeth his children, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.15. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by them to glorifie God, <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15 8. Thirdly, to make our election certaine to our ſelues, 2 <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 1.10. Fourthly, to winne others to Chriſt by our godly conuerſation, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.1. Laſtly, to aſſure our ſelues for certaine, that by hauing the true fruits of the true faith, wee haue that faith whereby we ſhall be ſaued, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.14. But they will doe their good workes, firſt to purge their owne ſinne. Secondly, by the ouerplus of good workes, to purge the ſinnes of others. Thirdly, to ſtay their ſoules from death. Fourthly, to purchaſe Heauen. And laſtly, to lift vp, and place their ſoules in Heauen. They will haue all by their owne deſeruings, or they will haue none: all by merits, or elſe no bargaine: therefore let vs ſee what wee can ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto them touching this point.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 5. ſaith; <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdome of Heauen.</hi> Now this word <hi>Poore,</hi> is a metaphor, taken from a man that is ſo very poore, as that hee hath not wherewith to ſuſtaine his owne life, but is faine to ſeeke to others for ſuccour. And ſuch are they which finde themſelues ſo greatly deſtitute of ſoules ſuſtenance, as that they are glad to ſeeke to others for reliefe, euen to God for his mercy, and to Chriſt for his merites.</p>

That will haue their Church to be the moſt auncient Apoſtolique and Catholique Church, which in our fifth Chapter, we proued had no being at all, for the ſpace of ſixe hundred and ſixe yeares next after Chriſt.
