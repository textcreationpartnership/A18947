    _ CHAPTER I. This Chapter tendeth to reſolue all men, that notwithſtanding both Proteſtants and Papiſts profeſſe but one God, one Faith, one Baptiſme, and one Lord Ieſus Christ, that yet there is ſo great a difference in the manner of their profeſsion, that it is not poſsible that they ſhould be combined and conioyned together to make one and the ſame true Church of Chriſt.

Chapter of the Reuelation, calleth the Mother of Whordomes and abominations of the Earth: And which the other Angell in the 18. Chapter ſaith, is falne, and become the habitation of Deuils, the hold of all foule ſpirits, and cage of euery vncleane and hatefull Bird.

    _ CHAP. IIII. Tending to reſolue all men, that as Saint Iohn in his 17. chapter of the Reuelation, declareth the Church of Antichrist, to be a Church profeſsing Christ, and yet an Idolatrous Church; ſo the Popiſh Church must needes bee that idolatrous Church, becauſe there is no more Churches in the World (profeſsing Christ) but theirs which vſe Images, and ours which vſe none: which are now distinguiſhed (therefore) by the titles of Papiſts and Proteſtants.

    _ CHAP. V. Tending to reſolue all men, that for the firſt 606. yeeres next after Chriſt, the Papiſts had no Church, neither could haue; becauſe till then it had no vniuerſall Pope to make it a Popiſh Church: Neither was that firſt Church of Rome (which Saint Peter planted) the Mother, but one of the Daughters of the Mother Church, in which Chriſt himſelfe firſt planted that Faith and Religion, (which afterwards by meanes of his Apoſtles ſhould be made Catholique) 14. yeeres before Peter came to Rome. So that hereby wee ſhall ſee the Antiquity of their Church ouerthrowne, and Ieruſalem to be the moſt ancient, and true figure of the vniuerſall Mother Church, to wit, heauenly Ieruſalem, and not Rome.

    _ CHAP. VI. Tending to reſolue all men, that the Popiſh Church, and the ſucceſsion of ſingular vniuerſall Popes, had their firſt beginning but in the yeere of Chriſt 607. and that alſo from that time that they had a Church, wee had a Church continually among them, till about 20. yeeres before Luthers time. And as before they had a Church, which did extend it ſelfe farre and wide, ſo euen then and at all times, in other parts of Chriſtendome, (as in Aſia, Affrica, Macedonia, Miſia, Valachia, Ruſſia, Muſchouia, &c.) we had as great a Church as they, if not greater. Which being proued, both their antiquity, vniuerſality, and ſucceſsion of vniuerſall Popes, will proue but a fond fable, and a meere illuſion of Antichriſt.

    _ CHAP. VII. Tending to reſolue all men, that the Papiſts great boaſting of their generall conſent from Saint Peters time, is but a very Antichriſtian illuſion: that their antiquiy of the Popes vniuerſall Supremacie, is but a fallacie: that the ſucceſsion of vniuerſall Popes deſcended from Saint Peter, is without veritie: and all of them together flat forgeries: euen as wee haue already proued their other Principles to be, and as in this Chapter (God willing) we ſhall proue them all to be.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Tending to reſolue all men, that the Apoſtle Saint Peters authority was but the ſame that the other Apoſtles was: and therefore that ſupreame authority which the Pope Claymeth from Saint Peter, is fabilous. That Chriſt alone is the ſupreame head of the Church, euen of that part that is Millitant, as that which is Triumphant. That Ieruſalem is the moſt ancient Mother of the Catholique Church: that the Popiſh is the Church of Antichriſt, and therefore it is blaſphemy to affirme it to be the ſame which Saint Peter firſt planted in Rome. That there was no Church planted in Rome till the yeere of Chriſt 44 before which time there were many Christian
Churches planted in the World, therefore Rome could not be the Mother, but a Daughter of the Mother Church.

    _ CHAP. IX. Tending to reſolue all men, that the Popiſh Church cannot be the true and most auncient Catholique Church, becauſe the most auncient Apostolike Church was knowne by hauing onely two Sacraments, and theirs hath ſeauen; which iust number, as they can not bee found in Scriptures; ſo can they not be found once named by any of the foure first generall Councels, or any Prouinciall Councell, or any of the auncient Fathers, till after the riſing of the great Antichrist in Rome.
Alſo that their Maſſe was inuented by man, and not the ordinance of Christ and his Apostles. That it tendeth to the ouerthrow of the power of Christs Sacrifice on the Croſſe; casteth mens mindes into a doubtfull wauering of their ſaluation, and finally diſſolueth the whole harmony of the Scriptures, both Propheticall and Apostolicall.

    _ CHAP. X. Tending to reſolue all men, that the words of Chriſt, in the ſixt Chapter of Saint Iohns Goſpell (touching the eating his fleſh, and drinking his bloud) are onely but
figuratiue ſpeeches: as alſo thoſe his other words, when he inſtituted the Sacrament, and deliuering the Bread to his Apoſtles, ſaid: Take, eate, this is my body which is giuen for you.

of the Law: the other, that wee are ſaued by faith and workes together. That becauſe no man can fulfill the Law, no man can be iuſtified by the Law. That God was not vniuſt in giuing ſuch a Law, as he knew no man was able to fulfill. That to ſeeke to merit ſaluation, is the high way to damnation.
